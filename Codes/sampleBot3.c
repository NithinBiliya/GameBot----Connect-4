	It is very useful during the development of the bots for testing pursoses... 
	You can pitch your actual bot against this bot so that you can give inputs from the keyboard and play with the other bot...
	Make sure the inputs are from 0 to 6...

	You have to paste the code which is inside this function into the function named bot1() or bot2() in game.c file to see how it works.
